# Android-Sensors-Realtime-Graph-App

The goal of this assignment was to plot sensor values, their mean, and their variance over time. The user
will be able to choose  between Accelerometer or Light sensor. Once the sensor type is chosen, the user will be
taken to a second activity that presents sensor data in two formats: (a) raw values, means, and standard
deviations over time, and (b) an animated image based on the current sensor reading. 


Plot shifts to the left when the line reaches the right
edge. Dynamic adjustment of X- and Y-axis.
